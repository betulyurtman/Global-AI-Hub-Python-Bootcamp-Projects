# Global-AI-Hub-Python-Bootcamp-Projects
This repository contains two projects that are prepared for Python Bootcamp. Me and my teammate prepared these projects in July. I am going to re-do and update these projects and share with you.

First project is "Student Grading System" which contains basic Pthon knowledge and creating and Excel spreadsheet using Python.

Second project is "Netflix Original Movies IMDB Scores" which contains data analysis and data visualization.
